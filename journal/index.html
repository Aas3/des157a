        <h2>Game Design UX Best Practices</h2>
        <date>Mar/1/2023</date>
    
        <p>The article this week was very interesting and insightful. It brought to light all the patterns I had never noticed in game apps. I felt like a lot of these strategies could be used in other platforms as well, but I definitely see how they are helpful when creating games specifically. Strategies such as comfortable-to-reach positioning are really important for games because you want users to be able to play and interact in a way that's most comfortable and convenient for their body movement and hand placement. Another strategy that the article shed light on was how to indicate sliders. To indicate that a section has sliders, it is important to make the extended information partially visible so that it indicates to users that there is additional content. It could also be helpful to show a scrolling animation when the screen is first presented. Overall, this article helped me better understand common strategies to improve not only the game's design but also the user's experience.</p>

        <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
        <date>Feb/15/2023</date>
    
        <p> 
            This assignment will be an archive of my interests, things I like, and items I use regularly. My photo shows a bucket filled with paints, which is one of my hobbies. I have liked painting since I was a child, and used to create paintings for my family and friends.
            Despite having all the necessary supplies, I don't paint as often as I would like. Because of this, most of the paints in the bucket are barely used and remain there throughout the year.
            <img src="images/20230208_202823.jpg" alt="paints" style="width:100%">

        <p> 
            Since the image depicts a cat with hearts surrounding its face, I assume it is about Chelsea's pet cat  and how much she loves it. What is interesting about this image is that, although it is a photo of a real cat, there are graphic hearts surrounding its head. Another intriguing aspect is the use of the center-dominant eye for the photo composition.
            <br>
            The most obvious feature of the image is the bright and bold colors of the hearts around the cat's head, and the cat itself. The more mysterious aspect of the image is the cat's location; it appears to be under a bed, but that may not be the case. Also, I am unsure if this cat belongs to Chelsea. It could possibly be her friend's or her roommate's, and I am only assuming that it is hers.

        <h2>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</h2>
        <date>Feb/8/2023</date>
    
        <p> I thought it was interesting that an image with no context could engage students so much. This article truly sheds light on how important and impactful an image can be, not just to its subject matter, but to a broader audience as well. Analyzing photos with little to no context can broaden one's visual thinking skills and spark new conversations that have not been explored. Drawing ideas from observations can also build curiosity towards the subject matter. I believe that through this practice, one can develop stronger skills in quick thinking and creativity.<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">The New York Times</a> article as well as the <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">awwwards.com</a> example, taught me the importance of imagery, what you as the designer could do with it, and the effect it could have on your audience.</p>

        <h2>Overuse of Overlays</h2>
        <date>Feb/5/2023</date>

        <p>The article discusses the use of overlays and its potential impact on the user experience. Designers often use overlays because they provide quick access to content and information. However, there are many factors to consider before implementation, such as the length of the content, the overlay's flexibility for mobile devices, and the possibility of it being standalone content. The article caused me to reflect on my past experiences with overlays, many of which were frustrating and similar to the examples mentioned. Before reading the article, I was not very interested in using overlays, mainly because I rarely had good experiences with them. However, I am now more open to the idea and believe that overlays would be good for short content, promotions, notices, warnings, or any information that needs to be communicated quickly to the user.

        <h2>Best Practice for Form Design</h2>
        <date>Jan/26/2023</date>

        <p>This week's article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practice for Form Design</a> delved into the topic of forms, specifically the methods used to create a good form design. Just like websites, forms have their own set of practices and patterns. These patterns help guide users through the forms as smoothly as possible. These patterns include single columns, input labels, progress bars, required fields, input requirements, hierarchy of information needed, error feedbacks, and color contrast, just to name a few. A lot of these patterns are implemented to help users better understand each field and the content needed. By making these forms easy to navigate and understand, designers can increase users' retention and likelihood of completing the form.
        </p>

     <br>
        <p>After analyzing multiple forms, I have realized that they all incorporate many of the practices mentioned in the article. For example, 
            <a href="https://discord.com/register?redirect_to=%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3Fclient_id%3D936929561302675456%26scope%3Didentify%2520email%2520guilds.members.read%26response_type%3Dcode%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.midjourney.com%252Fapi%252Fauth%252Fcallback%252Fdiscord%26state%3Db0aCgUg58oPAMaSCaywBMAiFY2Y2uLwAYtExEKqLq8A">Discord's</a> registration form has input titles, placeholder text, contrasting colors, and provides error feedback messages when an input does not fulfill a requirement. Their login form also uses asterisks to indicate which inputs need to be completed. Similarly, when creating a form in Google Forms, it is structured in the same format as the article describes, with columns, an option for creating a required field, customizable title fields, and a description option where examples and input requirements can be added.
