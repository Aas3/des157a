        <p>This week's article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practice for Form Design</a> delved into the topic of forms, specifically the methods used to create a good form design. Just like websites, forms have their own set of practices and patterns. These patterns help guide users through the forms as smoothly as possible. These patterns include single columns, input labels, progress bars, required fields, input requirements, hierarchy of information needed, error feedbacks, and color contrast, just to name a few. A lot of these patterns are implemented to help users better understand each field and the content needed. By making these forms easy to navigate and understand, designers can increase users' retention and likelihood of completing the form.

        <p>After analyzing multiple forms, I have realized that they all incorporate many of the practices mentioned in the article. For example, 
            <a href="https://discord.com/register?redirect_to=%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3Fclient_id%3D936929561302675456%26scope%3Didentify%2520email%2520guilds.members.read%26response_type%3Dcode%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.midjourney.com%252Fapi%252Fauth%252Fcallback%252Fdiscord%26state%3Db0aCgUg58oPAMaSCaywBMAiFY2Y2uLwAYtExEKqLq8A">Discord's</a> registration form has input titles, placeholder text, contrasting colors, and provides error feedback messages when an input does not fulfill a requirement. Their login form also uses asterisks to indicate which inputs need to be completed. Similarly, when creating a form in Google Forms, it is structured in the same format as the article describes, with columns, an option for creating a required field, customizable title fields, and a description option where examples and input requirements can be added.
