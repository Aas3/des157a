        <p> I thought it was interesting that an image with no context could engage students so much. This article truly sheds light on how important and impactful an image can be, not just to its subject matter, but to a broader audience as well. Analyzing photos with little to no context can broaden one's visual thinking skills and spark new conversations that have not been explored. Drawing ideas from observations can also build curiosity towards the subject matter. I believe that through this practice, one can develop stronger skills in quick thinking and creativity.<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">The New York Times</a> article as well as the <a href="awwwards.com">awwwards.com</a> example, taught me the importance of imagery, what you as the designer could do with it, and the effect it could have on your audience.</p>

        <h2>Overuse of Overlays</h2>
        <h3>Afrah Said</h3>

        <p>The article discusses the use of overlays and its potential impact on the user experience. Designers often use overlays because they provide quick access to content and information. However, there are many factors to consider before implementation, such as the length of the content, the overlay's flexibility for mobile devices, and the possibility of it being standalone content. The article caused me to reflect on my past experiences with overlays, many of which were frustrating and similar to the examples mentioned. Before reading the article, I was not very interested in using overlays, mainly because I rarely had good experiences with them. However, I am now more open to the idea and believe that overlays would be good for short content, promotions, notices, warnings, or any information that needs to be communicated quickly to the user.

        <h2>Best Practice for Form Design</h2>
        <h3>Afrah Said</h3>
        <date>Jan/26/2023</date>

        <p>This week's article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practice for Form Design</a> delved into the topic of forms, specifically the methods used to create a good form design. Just like websites, forms have their own set of practices and patterns. These patterns help guide users through the forms as smoothly as possible. These patterns include single columns, input labels, progress bars, required fields, input requirements, hierarchy of information needed, error feedbacks, and color contrast, just to name a few. A lot of these patterns are implemented to help users better understand each field and the content needed. By making these forms easy to navigate and understand, designers can increase users' retention and likelihood of completing the form.

        <p>After analyzing multiple forms, I have realized that they all incorporate many of the practices mentioned in the article. For example, 
            <a href="https://discord.com/register?redirect_to=%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3Fclient_id%3D936929561302675456%26scope%3Didentify%2520email%2520guilds.members.read%26response_type%3Dcode%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.midjourney.com%252Fapi%252Fauth%252Fcallback%252Fdiscord%26state%3Db0aCgUg58oPAMaSCaywBMAiFY2Y2uLwAYtExEKqLq8A">Discord's</a> registration form has input titles, placeholder text, contrasting colors, and provides error feedback messages when an input does not fulfill a requirement. Their login form also uses asterisks to indicate which inputs need to be completed. Similarly, when creating a form in Google Forms, it is structured in the same format as the article describes, with columns, an option for creating a required field, customizable title fields, and a description option where examples and input requirements can be added.
