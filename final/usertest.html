        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <p>after user testing, these were the three things I obsered:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigation<p>In terms of navigating through the page, users seemed to understand, but it could definitelybe improved. </p></li>
            <li>Layout <p>Because my code wasnt fully compleated, the layout of my content was not ideal. Some of my testers sugested having some elements stacked, one also mentioned that using a nav bar may work better for my page since i plan to add a scrolling effect.</p></li>
            <li>Functionality<p> Like i mentioned, beecause my pade was incompleat some of its funtionality were wonky or not implemented yet. One of my testers mentioned that it would be nice to have a 'scroll to top' button, just to helps users navigate more efficently.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <P>After listening to my classmate's feedback, I think im going to try to incorperate some of their suggestions. My main goal right now it to get my main functions to work, but as soon as i get that down, i plan to add more stylistic elements.</P>
