            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>For my final project I plan to revise and improve my Every Picture project.</p>
        </article>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>My goals are to incorporate more aspects of myself,  and paint a more vivid story for the users. Ultimately, I want it to give a better and more in depth introduction to myself. I would like my Pictures to tell more of my story than my text. I also what the scroll elements to be a lot more gun and interactive. My goal is for users to have a better understanding of me as they navigate through my web page. </p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>I think I would like to keep the paper background, I like that it adds texture to my page. But I do plan to change up the layout of the content. I would like my page to look more visually interesting, rather than ordered and predictable. As for type, I want to keep the typewriter typeface accompanied with some sort of serif typeface.  </p>

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>I would like for each photo to fade or transition in somehow. I think I would be nice if each photo had a different behavior assigned to it. I think I would also like to add captions that pop up depending on the user's mouse position. </p>

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>I would like users to have fun with my page. Although it focuses on introducing myself, I would like it to keep the audience's interest and participation. </p>
